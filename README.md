# Creditcard-fraud-detection

This script is designed to detect credit card fraud using a dataset of credit card transactions. 

## Libraries Used

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- gridspec from matplotlib

## Data

The data is loaded from a CSV file named "creditcard.csv". The data is then displayed using the head() function and its shape and description are printed.

## Fraud Detection

The script separates the data into fraudulent and valid transactions. It then calculates the fraction of transactions that are fraudulent and prints this information along with the number of fraudulent and valid transactions.

## Transaction Details

The script prints the details of the fraudulent and valid transactions.

## Visualization

A line chart is generated to visualize the relationship between time and the amount of the transaction.
